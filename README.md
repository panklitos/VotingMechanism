# VotingMechanism

How it works:

1.	The administrator deploys the proposed smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain using the contract address of the ERC20 token
2.	The administrator assigns to the Voting mechanism contract a number of tokens that will be used for rewarding voters
3.	The administrator sets the voting reward amount and the rewarding address which is the address of the user which deposited the total reward amount on the voting smart contract
4.	The administrator creates a poll with the Poll Title, End Date and the list of four available options
5.	Users that own at least 1 token can vote on polls by specifying the poll number and the option they wish to vote. Users can only vote once on each poll.
6.	Users are rewarded for their participation
7.	All transactions are recorded and verified on the Blockchain
8.	The results of the polls are publicly available
9.	The results can be shared with interested parties
