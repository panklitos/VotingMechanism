# VotingMechanism: Engaging ERC20 token holders in decision-making


How it works:

1.	Firstly an administrator of the organization (Contract Owners) must deploy the proposed Voting mechanism smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain using as a variable the contract address of any existing ERC20 token.
2.	Then the admin or any other user of the organization with huge amount of tokens must assign/send to the newly deployed voting mechanism contract a number of tokens that will to be used for rewarding tokens holders that voted (voters)
3.	In this step the admin sets the reward amount per vote and the rewarding address. Please bear in mind that the rewarding address must be the exactly the same address of the user who deposited the total reward amount on the voting smart contract during part 2.
4.	Now the admin can begin creating various polls by defining a poll title, an end date and a list of the available options that token holders can vote for.
5.	After the creation of a poll users that own at least 1 token can vote on polls. Please bear in ind that each user can only vote once on each poll.
6.	After a succesful vote a user is rewarded with ERC20 tokens for his/her participation
7.	All transactions are recorded and verified on the Blockchain
8.	Results of the polls are publicly available and can be shared with interested parties
